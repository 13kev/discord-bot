# discord-bot
discord bot to welcome new members that arrive at the server and provides random content to keep them entertained
I'm doing this project as part of a udemy course im attending to create a Discord bot using a node.js module called Discord.js

Initial commits were:
1 - install npm init
2 - Discord.js
3 - Require the module
4 - Defined the intents needed for this bot to function
5 - Defined the partials to read the full data of the objects returned from each event
